test_kernel
===========

A simple 32-bit kernel which can run in QEMU

Only dependency for building is GCC.

Easiest way to test is with QEMU, not tested with any other loaders so probably doesn't even work with anything other than SeaBIOS.

### Instructions

```bash
make # Compile
make run # Run
```
